1. **Encrypt Data**: Input your environment variables. Encryption happens directly in your browser using AES-GCM.  
2. **Generate Link**: A secure link is created for sharing.  
3. **Control Access**: Set a limit for the number of times the link can be accessed and define an expiration time.  
4. **Share Securely**: Share the generated link with confidence.
